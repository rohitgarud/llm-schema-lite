## Metric integrity

Same prompt, same model, greedy: without `response_format` → `{'prompt_tokens': 21, 'completion_tokens': 160}`; with `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` → `{'prompt_tokens': 173, 'completion_tokens': 7}` (identical 649-char reasoning trace in both). Ollama re-prefills the thinking trace and bills it as *prompt* tokens under constrained decoding. Since YAML mode and `ChatAdapter` send **no** `response_format` while JSON/JSONISH/`JSONAdapter`/`BAMLAdapter` send `json_object`, the two groups are **not** on the same accounting basis. Total tokens stay comparable (181 vs 180).

prompt/completion token counts are NOT comparable across the `response_format` groups

field accuracy is micro-averaged over the **expected** fields of every case: a cell that raised scores 0 against its full denominator rather than being excluded, and emitting fewer fields can never raise the score. Fields the model invents are reported under `spurious` and break `exact`, but do not enter the denominator. A correct `None` also counts as a match, so on a sparse corpus field accuracy pays a reply for extracting nothing. **recall (non-null gold)** is the extraction-quality headline: matches over only the fields whose gold value is not `None`, a cell that raised scoring 0 against them, so extracting nothing scores 0. **invented (null gold)** is the other half: of the fields whose gold is `None`, how many the reply filled anyway. Ground truth is the generated record the prose was rendered from, so the corpus measures schema-following under paraphrase — not real-world extraction.

The offline prompt-cost table and the live outcomes table are never joined into one table or one derived score.

**All-null floor: 0.025** — the field accuracy of a reply that extracts nothing (every output field `None`) on these same cases. A correct `None` counts as a match, so field accuracy is only a distance from this floor, and an adapter near it may simply have extracted nothing. Recall (non-null gold) has a floor of 0 by construction: compare adapters on that.
